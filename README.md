# Life CHANGELOG

The idea for personal changelog is simple: It tracks changes and updates in your life or projects. I got the idea from software projects changelogs that I love to write, they summarize each release changes beautifully.

## What semver means in Life CHANGELOG

- **Major** version means something big has happened.
- **Minor** version means something larger than usual, but nothing significant has happened. Usually more changes or some step forward.
- **Patch** version means everyday change. This is the most common version, every day life updates.
- Optional or pre-release labels are probably not used in this changelog.
